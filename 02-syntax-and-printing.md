# Syntax and Printing
While writing a program we’ll be using two tools:
1. **Text Editor**: The place where you tell a program what to do.

2. **Console**: The place where the computer returns information after
processing what you asked it to do.

You’ll be spending a huge portion of your time writing your programs and
code using a text editor, before running the code via a console.

As a budding programmer like yourself, you’ll have to write lots and lots
of code. How you write the code is very important - you need to follow
some rules when you write this code. Otherwise, the computer can’t
understand what you’re writing at all, and your code won’t run! This is
what we call _‘Syntax’_. It is the arrangement of words to create sentences
in a language. Just like we how we need to follow proper grammar rules in
any language (like Hindi and English), we do the same in Python. We will
cover the rules of writing any code in Python as we go along talking about
what you can do using this programming language.

So, let’s get started with talking to a computer in Python!

We’ll start off with the tool in programming that you’ll use the most;
printing. It basically returns whatever you give it.

Let’s take the following as an example:
`print(“Hi, My Name is Eve!”)`

There are two important parts to this:
1. “Hi, My Name is Eve!”: This is called a string. For now think of it as a
chain of letters, numbers or anything you can tSyntax and Printingype on your
keyboard.

2. `print()`: Anything you put in between the brackets is returned by the
computer into the console.

Let’s test this out! Print out your name and press the compile button.

During the course of this tutorial, you will come across many statements
starting with a hashtag(#). These are known as comments and are used to
explain to code to people who read it - these are not run by the computer.
```.py
print(“Hello”)
#Hello is printed on the screen whereas this comment is not.
```
## Question

Eve wants the computer to know the address to her family bakery (Eve’s
Family Bakery, 155 Main St, Bihar 84101, INDIA). Print the address to let
the computer know!

## Solution:
```.py
print(“Eve’s Family Bakery, 155 Main St, Bihar 84101, INDIA”)
```
