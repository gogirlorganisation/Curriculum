# Conditionals - True and False

Eve's parents agreed to buy her a new mobile when she turns 18. Therefore, if
the condition is met (True, her age being 18), then she gets her new mobile; if
not (False), then she won’t get it. Similarly, there are conditions in
programming. Conditional values can be stored in another type of data called
‘booleans’.

A boolean has two states, either true or false. If a boolean value is True,
then its value is one; and if a boolean value is False, its value is zero.

The status of conditionals can be checked using relational operators. The four
main relational operators we will be covering are > (greater than), < (less
than),  == (equals to) and != (not equals to). Some examples would be:

```.py
print(3 < 4 )		      #Output: True
print(7 == 9)			    #Output: False
print(4 > 3)  			  #Output: True
print(5 < 2) 			    #Output: False
print(5 - 3 == 4 - 2) #Output: True
print(3 != 6)			    #Output: True
```

If a check such as (3 > 4) is put, the the boolean will be set to False.
For example: Eve got a phone call for booking 200 loaves of bread. But, she
knows her family cannot bake more than 150, so she turned down the order.
That’s because 200 < 150 is False.

Conditions are often used to determine whether or not certain blocks of code
are executed. We will learn more about this in the next section, control flow.

## Question
Eve and her Friends are playing the game Two Truths One Lie. Help her out by
printing a True; then, print a False and finally a True by using relational
operators in mathematical expressions.
