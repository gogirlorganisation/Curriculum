# Introduction
Ever heard the phrase “Work smart, not hard”?  Well, computers don’t do
that at
all. It’s best to think of a computer as a really dumb but hard working
human
being. It can do great things with good guidance, like running Facebook.
But
without that guidance, it’s just a hunk of metal. That’s where you come in:
with your guidance and support, you can make a computer do great things.

In this tutorial some words will be underlined and can be clicked upon for
explanation **like this** (Good job! You’ve opened up an explanation for
‘like this’ and you can do it **again**! (Wow, you’re terrific at this!))

Before we go any further and make cool stuff like the next Google, let’s
figure out how to talk to these computers.

Computers can only understand programming languages. This means that they
cannot understand human languages. So, humans have developed some languages
which help the computer understand what we want it to do. A program is an
algorithm written in one of these languages.

This course is covering one of the most popular programming languages,
Python 3.5.
